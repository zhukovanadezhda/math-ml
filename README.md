# Linear Algebra & Basic Math for Machine Learning

Welcome to my personal project, where I explore and rebuild the basic concepts of linear algebra and fundamental mathematics that underpin machine learning. I'm coding everything from scratch as a way to learn more deeply and to share my journey with anyone interested in the math behind ML algorithms.

## Project Overview

In modern machine learning, libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow often hide the underlying math. My aim here is to go back to the basics by implementing:

- **Core Vector and Matrix Operations:**  
  Starting with simple operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, and matrix multiplication.

- **Advanced Matrix Operations:**  
  Expanding to more complex tasks like transposition, inversion, calculating determinants, solving linear systems, and performing decompositions.

- **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Computations:**  
  These are essential for grasping dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA.

- **Integration into ML Algorithms:**  
  Ultimately, I hope to use these foundational math operations to build basic machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, PCA, etc.)
